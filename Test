  <center> The 4 stages of Mitosis:</center>
  <h2 class="Title"><strong>Prophase </strong>
    <p class = "right"> Prophase is the first stage of Mitosis. It takes place before Metaphase,<br> and during this phase, the nuclear envelope breaks down and chromatins turn into developed chromosomes.</p>

    <h2 class="Title"><em> Metaphase</em>
      <p class = "right">Metaphase Is the second stage of Mitosis. During this phase, the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell, and microtubules attach them. </p>

      <h2 class="Title"><em> Anaphase</em>
        <p class = "right"> Anaphase is the 3rd stage of Mitosis. During this phase, the chromosomes move farther away each other, and towards each end of the cell.

          <h2 class="Title"><em>Telophase</em>
            <p class = "right"> Telophase is the final main stage of Mitosis. During this phase, the chromosomes get moved into two groups where they make two new cells.
